# HAMRpro
retraining HAMR for a CIS 4190 project, this read me is a worklog.

4/21
Previously obtained the four human brain smRNA-seq data from GSE43335, cleaned, and mapped according to procedures described in Ryvkin et al. We now have 4 sam files. I'm going to assume that sam to bam, then bam pre-processing, then calling hamr will give me something similar to the paper. 
Currently still in the data cleaning step of the project.
